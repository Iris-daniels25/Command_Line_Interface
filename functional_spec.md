# Functional Specification

## Introduction
The Task Manager CLI helps users organize tasks in their terminal. It provides commands to add tasks, list tasks, and exit the program.

## User Stories
1. **Add Task**:  
   As a busy individual, I want to add new tasks quickly, so I can keep track of what needs to be done.

2. **List Tasks**:  
   As a user, I want to see all my tasks at once, so I can decide which one to do first.

3. **Exit Program**:  
   As a user, I want to exit the CLI when I’m done, so I can return to my normal workflow.

## Command Overview
- **add**: Prompts for a task, then stores it.
- **list**: Prints all tasks in order.
- **exit**: Terminates the CLI session.

Additional or optional sections could include:
- **User Interface** (just a text-based prompt)
- **Data Persistence** (if you’re saving tasks between runs, or mention that no data persists if you do not implement that yet)
